## Technologies 

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - Development Framework for the Java Language.

- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - Java library focused on productivity and boilerplate code reduction that, through annotations added to our code, teach the compiler (maven or gradle) during the compilation process to create Java code.

- [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/) - Framework that facilitates the creation and maintenance of code for test automation with results presentation.

- [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) - Open source test framework for Java released under the MIT license. The framework allows for the creation of dual test objects in automated unit tests for the purpose of test-driven development or behavior-driven development.

- [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/) - Framework for object-relational mapping written in Java language. (ORM)

- [JPA](https://hibernate.org/orm/) - Java specification that dictates how ORM Frameworks should be implemented.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Open source platform that facilitates the creation and administration of isolated environments. It makes it possible to package an application or environment inside a container, making it portable to any other host that has Docker installed.

- [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/) - Specification for machine-readable interface files for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.
